# briandaza.github.io

This is a repository intended to create a personal academic webpage. 

Currently, my webpage is hosted in GoogleSites: https://sites.google.com/view/briandaza/

Despite Google Sites provides a fancy environment, I'm planning to move my personal webpage to a Github hosted one because 
the potential it has to manage the inclusion of code chunks and to be modified from RStudio.

I'm not 'fluent' in the use of Github, so I expect this project will also help me to understand better how Github works.

At the time of starting this project, I don't know anything about web design or web hosting. So, let's see what do I get!

Some useful guides I found on the web are the following:

-  University of Glasgow Institute of Neuroscience and Psychologyâ€™s Academic Websites class
