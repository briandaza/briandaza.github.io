<br>During my last semesters at San Marcos, and shortly after graduating, I participated in the extension courses organized by the Central Reserve Bank of Perú both in Advanced Economics (2015) and Advanced Finance (2017). These are the most prestigious extension programs for undergraduate students in Peru in Economics and Finance. Only the top 36 students out of around 700 applicants among the best students in the country are usually admitted through a highly competitive selection process. These programs include graduate-level courses in macroeconomics, econometrics, microeconomics, mathematics, finance, and public policies.
