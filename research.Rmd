### Work in progress

- "Teenage Labor, Trade, and Market Access" [Working Paper Coming Soon - Draft Available by Request](mailto:bdaza@umich.edu)
<details>
  <summary><span style="color:blue;">Abstract</span>  </summary> 
  This paper exploits drastic tariff reductions and increased export possibilities to study their effects on teenage labor, its interaction with adult labor, and the role that market access plays in that interaction. In the context of Peru’s last liberalization episode that took place in the 2000s and the growth of China as the main Peruvian trade partner, I find that both episodes are associated with higher teenage labor participation in districts more exposed to them. These effects seem to be sharper in districts with lower market access, which is consistent with complementarities between adult labor and teenage labor in household production activities and contributes to explaining why child and teenage labor didn't decrease despite the severe reductions in poverty rates.

- "The Government Spending Multiplier in the Space"
<details>
  <summary><span style="color:blue;">Abstract</span>  </summary> 
  This project aims to study how incorporating intranational trade and geographical features into a quantitative macroeconomic model elucidates the impact of fiscal policy on aggregate demand and its propagation across regions within a country. Leveraging detailed regional budget and spending data from Peru, spanning 2007 to the present, and identification coming from changes in fiscal rules and rents from natural resources, the research aims to discern fiscal multipliers' interpretation and mechanisms considering regional dynamics, linkages, spatial heterogeneities, and trade costs.
