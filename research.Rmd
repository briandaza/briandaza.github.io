### Work in progress

- "Government Spending Multipliers and Distribution of Commodity Booms in the Spatial Economy" [Working Paper Coming Soon - Draft Available by Request](mailto:bdaza@umich.edu)

  <summary><span style="color:blue;">Abstract</span>  </summary> 
  The boom in the price of mineral commodities that began in the late 2000s has increased the financial funds available to governments in resource-abundant developing countries. Analyzing regional spending data from Peru, I utilize variations coming from the natural resource revenue distribution rules to estimate an open economy relative multiplier of 0.458. Household and firm-level microdata reveal consistent results on wages, expenditures, and income, despite no labor response. These findings, connected with spatial autoregressive analysis, motivate the importance of incorporating an spatial structural framework to relate the relative multiplier estimations to the aggregate multiplier and to assess mechanisms and distributional impacts.

- "Teenage Labor, Trade, and Market Access" [Working Paper Coming Soon - Draft Available by Request](mailto:bdaza@umich.edu)
<details>
  <summary><span style="color:blue;">Abstract</span>  </summary> 
  This paper exploits drastic tariff reductions and increased export possibilities to study their effects on teenage labor, its interaction with adult labor, and the role that market access plays in that interaction. In the context of Peru’s last liberalization episode that took place in the 2000s and the growth of China as the main Peruvian trade partner, I find that both episodes are associated with higher teenage labor participation in districts more exposed to them. These effects seem to be sharper in districts with lower market access, which is consistent with complementarities between adult labor and teenage labor in household production activities and contributes to explaining why child and teenage labor didn't decrease despite the severe reductions in poverty rates.
