### Work in progress

- "Teenage Labor, Trade, and Market Access" [Working Paper Coming Soon - Draft Available by Request](mailto:bdaza@umich.edu)
<details>
  <summary><span style="color:blue;">Abstract</span>  </summary> 
  This paper exploits drastic tariff reductions and increased export possibilities to study their effects on teenage labor, its interaction with adult labor, and the role that
market access plays in that interaction. In the context of Peru’s last liberalization episode that took place in the 2000s and the growth of China as the main Peruvian
trade partner, I find that both episodes are associated with higher teenage labor participation in districts more exposed to them. These effects seem to be sharper
in districts with lower market access, which is consistent with complementarities between adult labor and teenage labor in household production activities.
