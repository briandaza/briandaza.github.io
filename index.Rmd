# About

<div class = "row">


  
<div class = "col-md-8" align="justify">

Hi! I am Brian Daza. I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at University of Michigan. The topics I fancy the most are a subset of the union of trade, macro, and development economics.

My research experience includes being a Research Assistant at MIT, the World Bank's DIME, and the Research Center of Universidad del Pacífico. I also worked as a consultant for the Peruvian Government in the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Transports and Communication.

I hold a M.A.Sc in Data, Economics and Development Policy from MIT and a Bachelor of Economics from Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.

You can contact me at [bdaza@umich.edu](mailto:bdaza@umich.edu)

## Research

### Working Papers

- "Government Spending Multipliers and Distribution of Commodity Booms in the Spatial Economy"  
[Latest Version](https://briandaza.github.io/papers/BD-GSMSE-WP.pdf) (November, 2024)
<details>
  <summary><span> `Abstract` </span>  </summary> 
  This paper uses the regional redistribution of Peru's government revenue—increased due to the mineral commodity price boom in the 2000s—to estimate the effects of government spending. I begin by calculating local effects on households, workers, and firms, and a local open economy relative multiplier. Motivated by a general equilibrium framework, I then incorporate a Spatial Auto-Regressive (SAR) model to measure trade-related spatial spillovers. I find that increases in government spending stimulate larger relative output growth and positively impact relative wages, expenditures, and income. However, there is no corresponding relative rise in labor or value added. The spatial analysis helps interpret these results and measures the trade-related indirect effects of local spending on output.

### Selected Work in Progress

- "Teenage Labor, Trade, and Market Access"  
[Working Paper Coming Soon - Draft Available by Request](mailto:bdaza@umich.edu)
<details>
  <summary><span class="link-color"> `Abstract` </span>  </summary> 
  This paper exploits drastic tariff reductions and increased export possibilities to study their effects on teenage labor, its interaction with adult labor, and the role that market access plays in that interaction. In the context of Peru’s last liberalization episode that took place in the 2000s and the growth of China as the main Peruvian trade partner, I find that both episodes are associated with higher teenage labor participation in districts more exposed to them. These effects seem to be sharper in districts with lower market access, which is consistent with complementarities between adult labor and teenage labor in household production activities and contributes to explaining why child and teenage labor didn't decrease despite the severe reductions in poverty rates.
