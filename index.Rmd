Welcome, thank you for visiting my homepage.

I'm Research Assistant at [Universidad del Pacífico Research Center](https://ciup.up.edu.pe/), where I'm working for [Jorge Dávalos](http://www.up.edu.pe/en/Paginas/professor-profile.aspx?idd=000168211). During my assistantship, I have acquired experience in statistical modeling and microeconometrics in research projects related to environmental economics and labor economics.

I earned a B.Sc. in Economics from Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos and I have been admitted to the [Master Program in Data, Economics, and Development Policy](https://micromasters.mit.edu/dedp/blended-masters-program/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the class of 2020.

I am interested in pursuing an academic career in the field of Development Economics.
