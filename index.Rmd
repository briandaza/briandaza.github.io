# About

<div class = "row">


  
<div class = "col-md-8" align="justify">

Hi! I am Brian Daza. I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at University of Michigan. The topics I fancy the most are a subset of the union of trade, macro, and development economics.

My research experience includes being a Research Assistant at MIT, the World Bank's DIME, and the Research Center of Universidad del Pacífico. I also worked as a consultant for the Peruvian Government in the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Transports and Communication.

I hold a M.A.Sc in Data, Economics and Development Policy from MIT and a Bachelor of Economics from Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.

You can contact me at [bdaza@umich.edu](mailto:bdaza@umich.edu)

## Research

### Working Papers

- "Government Spending Multipliers and Distribution of Commodity Booms in the Spatial Economy" 
[Latest Version](https://briandaza.github.io/papers/BD-GSMSE-WP.pdf) (November, 2024)
<details>
  <summary><span> `Abstract` </span>  </summary> 
  The mineral commodity boom of the late 2000s increased financial funds for governments in resource-abundant developing countries. Using regional spending data from Peru, I estimate a local multiplier of 0.376 for government investment spending increases from canon and royalties. Microdata analysis reveals consistent impacts on wages, expenditures, and income, but no rise in labor or value added by formal firms. The main channel through which mining affects the economy is by enabling increases in government spending. I attribute the lack of labor response to rigidities or spatial spillovers, explored using a trade model and a Spatial Auto-Regressive (SAR) model.

### Selected Work in Progress

- "Teenage Labor, Trade, and Market Access" 
[Working Paper Coming Soon - Draft Available by Request](mailto:bdaza@umich.edu)
<details>
  <summary><span class="link-color"> `Abstract` </span>  </summary> 
  This paper exploits drastic tariff reductions and increased export possibilities to study their effects on teenage labor, its interaction with adult labor, and the role that market access plays in that interaction. In the context of Peru’s last liberalization episode that took place in the 2000s and the growth of China as the main Peruvian trade partner, I find that both episodes are associated with higher teenage labor participation in districts more exposed to them. These effects seem to be sharper in districts with lower market access, which is consistent with complementarities between adult labor and teenage labor in household production activities and contributes to explaining why child and teenage labor didn't decrease despite the severe reductions in poverty rates.
