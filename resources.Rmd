title: "Resources"
---

I contributed to put together a way [more comprehensive list of resources](https://econthaki.github.io/recursos/2021/01/05/recursos.html) useful for Econ students in [EconThaki's website](https://econthaki.github.io/recursos/2021/01/05/recursos.html).

In this page, I will keep a list of some open resources for students available in the web related to topics I'm interested in. I'm including it in this section to have an easier access to them and to allow other people to know about it. 

Despite I am a strong supporter of MOOCs in platforms like [edX](https://www.edx.org/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), I won't include their courses here because they are easier to find.
