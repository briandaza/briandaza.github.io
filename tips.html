<h1 class="title toc-ignore">27 Bad Survival Tips for New Econ
Ph.D. Students</h1>
<h4 class="author">Brian Daza</h4>

</div>


<p>I’ve seen a lot of fantastic advice on the internet and outside the
internet directly tailored at new Ph.D. students, written by people I
respect a lot and like whom I aspire to be when I grow up. If you found
this thing, I am completely sure you found that stuff as well, and I’m
also sure you received a lot of tips as well from senior students, he
people who wrote your letters of recommendation, the faculty members of
the institution you are joining, and other people who cares about you.
If I am sharing these following tips is not because I think you will
need them to be a better student, enjoy your life more, or become a
better prospective. I don’t even know you are you in particular. If I am
writing this is because I am revisiting some notes I took when I was in
the position of being a new Ph.D. student and felt lost and numb on my
own special ways, or after talking with peers.</p>
<p>My notes were sometimes kind of sparse and vague, so I unfortunately
I don’t always remember what I meant what I wrote them. I think this is
unfortunate. We usually give a lot of voice to the winners, to the
survivors, to the successful, etcetera. I think I was doing good on
saving these ideas, I wish I did it better and ellaborated more on them.
But I guess I was busy dealing with some version of the Jorgenson’s
formula or figuring out if some set was compact or not.</p>
<p>There you have the motivation for this. I just want to prevent some
collecive memories - OK, mainly personal ones - to get lost.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>All advice is wrong. But some is useful. All the scientific
knowledge is based on assumptions that we know aren’t true but hopefully
gives some tractable guidance about the real world which of course we
approach through the positivist assumption that it is real. If a model
doesn’t fit the data, or doesn’t help you, you wouldn’t say the world is
the one at fault. It would be very dumb if you persevere on wrong ideas
just because they sound coherent on their own. You are very different
than the extremists screaming freedom while showing how much a prisoner
of hatred and ignorance they are. Don’t persevere following advice you
realize it is not good for you or it is not working for you. There is
nothing wrong with you if the productivity hacks that seem to work for
other people are useless for you. Just for example, if the idea of
“doing the same little effort everyday with consistence” terrifies you
instead of helping you, embrace your style and look for what works
better for you. Balance your discipline and your motivation. For me,
doing something twenty times with whole intent is more effective than
doing it 365 and feeling it like a burden. At the end, <span
class="math inline">\(1.20^{20} \approx 1.01^{135}\)</span>. Choose the
fighter that suits you the best.</p></li>
<li><p>You are in a great moment to make mistakes, though. So take
advantage of it.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the first weeks to learn how you are going to get around your
new environment. Be as detailed as possible: make sure you know the
options you have to feed yourself, try different work schedules, sleep
strategies, and new ways to entertain yourself, take pictures of
yourself, draw a portrait of yourself, take that ‘Which Hogwarts house
you belong?’ test, figure out where in the classrooms you will feel the
most comfortable, take personality tests, reach out to a health
professional, ask your friends stuff like “If I were an animal, which
one I would be?”, look at your birth chart and see if the description
suits you, chat to people and ask them what are the stereotypes they
would have on you based on your background, ask people you think is
similar to you for advice, etc. Please, do everything you can to know
yourself better. You need that to know better how to deal with your
emotions, energy, and time. This will be more useful than remembering
how to check if some particular thing approaches to another thing based
on some convergence criteria.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid the following conversation:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>– “How are you?” – “Fine. And you?” – “Fine too.”</p>
<p>One of the cultural shocks that most frequently pops up on my
friends’ experiences is that, in the US and other countries, people
don’t care to the actual answer of the “how are you?” question. It’s
just a fancy “Hi!” and the conversation gets weird if you actually talk
about how are you. So, many of them give up on actually answering and
they are always like: “Fine.”</p>
<p>Please don’t do that unless you are in a line with 50 people waiting
to talk with this person, or something. Be honest and say how you feel,
even if it’s something like: “Wondering how my grandma’s cat is doing
back home. Probably she’s just wandering around the roofs. Do you think
she misses me?”, “I am thinking of tying my hair blue. But I’m afraid it
won’t match my outfits. How about you?”. If you don’t want to talk to
much: “I’m tired. How about you?” takes the same time as “Fine. And
you?”. If you don’t want to talk about you, say something like: “I’m
fine, but not as fine as your outfit! Where did you get those boots
from?”.</p>
<p>You see my point, right? It’s true most people don’t care how are you
doing. But it’s good to identify those who do actually care or are
interested.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Interact with your peers. This might be obvious for you. But you
will see there’s people that never interact with others. If you are one
of those, on the contrary, you might be like: “I’m not doing so. I can
handle this alone.” I believe you. But even if you are fine and not
feeling like you need or want to see other people, try to interact. I’m
not asking you to become a party animal or to work always in groups. I
do prefer to do my things in my own as well (like really, you won’t
imagine how much). But there are many ways in which talking with other
people helps. You will appreciate to discover that your apparently
unique approach to life is actually very similar to some philosophy that
is exotic to you, or that unexpected people are part of the same weird
fandoms as you.</p></li>
<li><p>People have different expectations regarding how social
interactions are supposed to work. That includes relationships,
friendships, business, etc. Try to learn from that and how that is
related to culture. Especially if you are a minority, you can face the
risk of feeling you are an alien. The cultural shock can be so strong,
that some of the people (including faculty) they told me they felt they
were teenagers for a second time. But the ‘strong’ in the last sentence
doesn’t always mean ’difficult, it also means intense.</p></li>
<li><p>Talk with faculty as if they were people, because they are. Don’t
try to be too strategic or to try to be flawless.</p></li>
<li><p>Nobody is flawless. Everyone struggles somehow and have any sort
of self-confidence issue.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="24" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Take accountability of your hour works.</p></li>
<li><p>Active leisure.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask “why is this important?”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Selfies are not enough. Make self-portraits of yourself. Take a Bach
song, and make it better.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li></li>
<li>Once them join the crew, you realize their flaws.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember there is a lot of passion behind each stuff you have in
front of you/.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Las notas no importan.</li>
<li>“Literally” dont matter. Literally comes from direct word meaning.
And all words are made up. &gt;&lt;</li>
<li>Buscate amigos grad students que no sean de tu field.</li>
<li>Busca amigos que no sean grad students.</li>
<li>Hazte amigo de tus compas.</li>
<li>Las amistades y relaciones sociales funcionan diferente en
diferentes culturas.</li>
<li>Ve a las office hours.</li>
<li>Todos los dias son hermosos.</li>
<li>No disfrutes del momento. Disfruta el proceso..</li>
<li>La colera, la tristeza, la envidia, pueden significar cosas buenas.
Busca qué mensajes te están dando, y atiendeles. On procrastination. La
belleza de las personas esta hecha para apreciarse en movimiento. People
are stalkers. Grstion del tiempo. Poner las cosas grandes primero, no
siempre funciona. It’s easy to underestimate and overestimate the time
you spent doing tasks. Try to measure it. Know your comparative
advantages. … and again, take other peoples advice with care. Even
though I’m saying this to you, I’m taking macro as a field. (I
definitely don’t have comparative advantage on that). There’s always
some humble-bragging on people’s advice. Sometimes people work less hard
as they appear or have a harder time keeping things together. There are
no bad intentions on this. Everyone of us wants some recognition or
understanding…. Remember that you are human. So you are emotional and
biological. Your productivity can be incredibly different if you take
care about your mood and your health. Maybe things would be different if
you were a machine? Not really. &gt;&lt; &gt;&lt; Easy and hard are not
useful constructs. Probably basic and advanced ate better. If someone
asks you how are you doing, never reply “Fine”. That’s a very boring,
ordinary, and useless answer. Ask faculty about what fields you should
take in the second year. If you think some parts of the first year will
be useless for your research, try to discuss that with faculty.
Specially those you think have similar research interests with yours.
You will be surprised by how much they agree or disagree. Go to that

</ol>
<p>Make a readme file on your previous projects?: That little project I
was starting just a little bit ago, actually has been resting for two
years now. &gt;&lt;</p>
<p>Whether you are intelligent enough is a pretty boring and useless
question. Lots of evidence shows that it is. Feel free to cherry pick
the evidence that shows your mind is awesome and critically disregard
the evidence that tells you otherwise (what’s their identification
strategy anyway?). The production function thing. Intelligent childs
praised by that, instead of hardwork. ~I watched a lot of TikToks
talking about that.~ There’s plenty Psychogical research on this topic.
My favorite on this regard is Esther Duflo’s article where she says she
did a poor work in a metrics coursework and doubted if she would be even
able to make a living as a researcher.</p>
<p>Easy and hard are pretty useless constructs.</p>
<p>Overestimate and underestimate your emotional response.</p>
